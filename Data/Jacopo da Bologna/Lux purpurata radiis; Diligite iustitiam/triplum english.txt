Light, flourishing under the rule
of the clement prince, comes adorned
with rays to chase away darkness.

His honour and brilliance
acquire throughout the whole age
renowned authority
of virtue and grace.

Saviour of the state.
the greatest cultivator of virtue.
effective and true lover.
constant in all study.
enemy of all vanity.
clement and just lord.
hard on the arrogant.
compassionate to the poor.
who irradiates for all a light
of salvation and reward.
