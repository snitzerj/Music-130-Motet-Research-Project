Since the band of thieves.
the den of grave-robbers.
and the fox who gnawed away at the roosters
while the blind lion reigned
all have suddenly fallen
by their own faults and encountered death
deprived of their possessions.
may the rooster now sing the words of Ovid
which cuttingly mock their deceit:
all man's fortunes are held
suspended by a thread
and when suddenly it breaks.
those who were strong fall.
