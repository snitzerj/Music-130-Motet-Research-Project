In a flash, raging Fortune
fearlessly toppled the tribe
which did not shrink from seizing power
in a disgraceful way;
she did not spare its leader the gibbet.
that she might reduce him publicly
as an eternal example for all men.
If any people in the future
should go beyond the limit.
in which case they may well fall
since such a tribe has just fallen.
they should know what fruits
falling to the depths will be:
after the gentle West Wind
the stormy tempest bears more affliction;
so also of sorrow after joy;
from which it follows
that nothing is better than to have nothing favourable.
