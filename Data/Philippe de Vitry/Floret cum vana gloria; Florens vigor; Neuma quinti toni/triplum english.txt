Together with vainglory the impudence
of the latest events grows and flourishes.
as do hypocrisy, boastfulness.
dissension, disputatiousness.
and disobedience;
from envy follow
seizure of property.
affliction in prosperity.
slander, hateful and
harmful whispering, and
gleeful exultation at misfortune
befalling one's neighbour;
from anger arise
insult and provocation.
the clamor of strife, and blasphemy;
conceit flourishes;
disgust is spreading all over.
as are mental derangement.
malice, sloth.
rancor, and despair;
from avarice flow
intrigue, treachery.
wickedness, perjury.
fraud and hardheartedness;
from gluttony come lust
and dulled sensation in taste;
from extravagance there result
buffoonery, garrulous.
empty merriment.
the distemper of this age, its
blindness, fickleness.
and inconsiderateness;
oh, horror - our glory will turn out
to be grievous ruin;
before God the odious love
of our flesh comes to naught.
