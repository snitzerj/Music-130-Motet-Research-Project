O growing power, justly victorious
over all in your vengeance.
in speaking for a day of judgement
you shall trust yourself to attain
the death penalty; they who by
bending their knee before Haman
debase proper observances, by
sticking with the adversary seek
to avoid all adversity; and thus
by sustaining falseness, justice
succumbs; by humiliating Mordecai
they prepare ruin, which they
will suffer doubly, as it turns
to befall themselves, when the
judge [Judge?], in smashing them.
will bestow his just rewards.
