"Most beloved beauty of a girl.
graced by the radiance of your body.
you have made the depths of my heart
serene to their very centre, with the sweetest wound."

"Raining down the spirit of love.
spirit that knows no way out of my breast.
you, most beloved, have made an implement
to strike me with a wound like your own."

"O queen, to be entwined
in your embrace, your breast..."


"O king of kings, let my eyes meet yours.
let our lips meet in a kiss.
and breathe into my mouth the word
through which my body may become godlike."
