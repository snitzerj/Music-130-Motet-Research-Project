You girls, why do you wonder
that I have thought it fitting
to wed a girl who is peerless
beyond the rest? -
since I have married one
as lovable as can be.

She is beautiful in looks.
gracious in manner.
and excellent in deed.
Any other girl among you is worthless.
far too rude in forwardness.
contemptuous of excellence.

She is light, you are clouds.
she a swift eagle.
you, creeping serpents.
She reigns beyond the skies
while you languish, deprived.
in a wretched valley.

This royal maiden
is a sweet mistress.
and my devoted bride.
I am a king - she is my queen!
Why do I tell all this?
I who know everything
have chosen a lady of worth.
one who is as a rose surpassing thorns.

Arise, then, all of you
(as time slips past
and death pursues us) -
serve this lady, call upon her!
If you neglect this.
you will never see
the glory for which you long -
ah, come quickly now!
