Laudable in virtue
commendable for character
lovely in appearance
undefiled in purity
desirable for preciousness
venerable in ancestry
awesome in power
with moral qualities beyond speech
wondrous in miracles.
O Mary, you are noble flesh.
It would be profitable to be of flesh
if you wished that through your graces
my wavering spirit might be restored
from wickedness to true humility
and become acceptable to God.
