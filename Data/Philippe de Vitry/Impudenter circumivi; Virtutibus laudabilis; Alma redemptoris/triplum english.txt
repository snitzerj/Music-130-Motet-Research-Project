Shamelessly I used to wander
over all the earth bounded by the sea;
recklessly I lusted
after anything that could corrupt loving.
When I was in love, but perhaps not loved.
I would be tormented for payment;
or if I was loved, but love was not in me.
I became unpleasant.
But when I loved and was loved
(I would join) on the occasion of this "match"
with any common Venus
in surging spasms.
after which my flesh would reek for a long wile
from the darts of love.
Well, what hero wishes to be burned by love
beyond a certain point?
This is not to say that loving should be prohibited.
But what girl should be loved?
She who was worthy to carry within her
the true God and Man;
worthy, because she was virtuous
and full of grace beyond all others.
strong in her pure beauty.
sweetness, humility and holiness.
When one loves this lady, he is loved in turn.
This is then a pleasant passion.
Love is made happy by him
who loves with the kiss of love itself.
O Mary, virgin parent.
burn my soul.
so that, obedient to your love.
I may avoid false love.
