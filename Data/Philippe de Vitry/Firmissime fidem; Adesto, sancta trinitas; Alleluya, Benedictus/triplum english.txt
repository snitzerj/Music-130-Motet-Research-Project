Let us steadfastly keep the faith:
may we worship the Father of the Trinity
who has cherished us with such great love
that he raised to life those given to death.
while he did not spare his own Son.
but surrendered Him to death for our sake.
Let us worship this same Son.
born for us, a propitiation for us.
who when He had been in form a God
accepted the form of a servant;
this He did in obedience to the Father.
and He died by being nailed to the cross.
Let us worship the Holy Comforter.
the Spirit of the highest Father and Son.
by whose grace we are governed
and by whose unction we are marked.
Now therefore let us revere
the Holy Trinity and pray the Unity
that by His grace we might prevail
to rejoice in glory.
