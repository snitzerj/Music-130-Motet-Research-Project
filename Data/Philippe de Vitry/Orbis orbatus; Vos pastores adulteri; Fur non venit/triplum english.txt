Deprived of its eyes.
the blind world stumbles in the daylight.
as every mitred priest
fights to enrich his relatives
while stuffing his own purse.
and Christ, in poverty.
cries out words for the starving people.
crying now with a hoarse voice.
"Repent ye, o sons!"
But since they have deaf ears
and are stiff-necked.
He must soon acuse these impious.
rash and wilful blasphemers
with these words:
"Why are you like vipers.
not deigning to listen?
Why does it appear that you press
like mute dogs into a crowd;
and having eaten of its flesh.
why do you not take up arms, as against wolves.
since you are already armed with their teeth?"
