The king whom the first letters of these lines depict,
contains within himself all things that nature gives to the blessed,
is the base of justice, a Trojan Julius in courage,
a Maccabean protector of the Church,
and a Hector in arms, honouring his country
and yet remaining a scholar of the covenants of theology;
he surpasses Julius Augustus as a man of moderation.
Since I cannot describe in words the virtues,
character, family, and deeds of a man so endowed,
may these things be celebrated above in the heavens.
