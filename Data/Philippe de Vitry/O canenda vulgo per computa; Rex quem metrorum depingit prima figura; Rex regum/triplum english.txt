O unspeakable madness of our age,
the very delirium of rabid dogs
(it should be openly exposed at every crossroad
how you have been from time immemorial
in collusion with the devil),
why do you, inviting damnation, proceed against that just man
whom you cannot tear with your teeth,
nor indict with your barking?
Why do you forsake your king,
honoured by the grace of his royal deeds,
whom an illustrious family of close affinity with the saints,
and the radiance, splendor, and brilliance given to him
place shining above all others,
just as gleaming Phoebus on arising
seems actually to remove the light from the night stars:
you ally yourself to the very sin against God,
miserable to say, that Jerusalem committed
in spurning her rightful Lord, Jesus.
