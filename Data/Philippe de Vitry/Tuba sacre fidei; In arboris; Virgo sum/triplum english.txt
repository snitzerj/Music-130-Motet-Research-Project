The trumpet of holy faith.
God's own statements.
herald of mysteries.
sounds forth to the audiences
that Reason.
the root of sin, wavers.
One must die
confessing more simply.
believing more firmly
in a God
in three equal persons.
and three in one.
And in a virgin
conceiving not by the seed of man.
but by the spirit of the Word.
she remaining a virgin;
and in a God and man
born to the world.
But whereas all these
transcendental things
are the life of the believing.
who are able
to be negligent of death.
reason.
acquired in nature by steps.
produces doubts at the beginning.
and guesswork as it proceeds.
Thus faith.
through which we can have
a clearer road to the beyond.
should always be followed.
