At the top of the tree
virginity sits pleasantly, bearing a child.
At the middle is mediating faith.
while at the foot, blind reason.
followed by her seven sisters (the liberal arts)
dwelling on their sophistries.
tries to climb in order to shine more brightly.
but the weakness of the branches (causes her)
to be dashed to the ground.
Thus either she asks for the hand of faith.
or strives eternally in vain.
