Meditating in the thick woods of a
wilderness not long ago, drawn to
rest, a murmuring brook in earshot.
a spell of sleep overcame me.

"Behold, a renowned prince appears.
his head bedecked by golden hair
and moreover by gold and gems, diversely
and skilfully worked through an amice.

A band of soldiers surrounds him.
and no less a number of recruits who
are ignorant of the meaning of want;
they all stand in awe of the celebrated one.

He doubles his hoard of treasure.
which his discerning rivals envy.
but his joyful people marvel when he
shares out this treasure on either side.

He draws from all corners of the world.
like the lodestone that attracts iron;
no great man can as much as pull himself away, nay
rather he must visit the threshold of the powerful one.

From this place, supported by flocks of poets
and giving ear to the advice of the learned.
he solves problems better than everyone and
he is superior to all in his writings and his laws.

The whole world, thunderstruck, is
astonished, admiring his great works.
When he quashes the uprisings of his
enemies, the din fills all the earth."

Then, delighting in such marvellous things.
and asking the name of this magnificent
and illustrious person, I learned forthwith
that he was that mighty one, Phebus.
