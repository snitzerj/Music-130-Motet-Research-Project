Flowing with nourishing rain-showers and a lively spring.
and flowering in the springtime with plants and trees.
a garden with shady places redolent with fragrances and aromas;
those seeking rest give praise, refreshed by these charms.
Girded by towers stretching to high heaven.
it nourishes the peacock arrayed in varied display;
this fertile spot produces abundant fruits
and provides pleasant recesses looking westward at sunset.
O what a spectacle: the farmer tends this place with a bull!
Such a marvel: the bull's mother guards this garden with her horns!
The hand of the rash one is rightly wary of any intrusion.
a wound having been made by your horns, O Mother Cow!
Whoever you are who enviously wish to rob this garden
of its fruit, beware lest you be caught by its farmer.
