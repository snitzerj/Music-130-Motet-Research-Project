The sun rising above the world.
circling through the ecliptic.
passing through the wonderful
signs of the Zodiac.

dispersing mists.
burns with clarifying strength.
and now from afar dispelling
wicked, noxious things.

it is a beam, setting on fire
with its heavenly light the deepest
recesses of the realm, warming the
rock and the antarctic locales.

softening hard hearts.
and now making plain
what was once mysterious
and obscure.

And you, O moon, suffering
an eclipse in your affairs.
recoiling from the illusory tail
of the dragon.

take in sufficient light
so that you aren't cast
into shadow by magic art.
and thus be in eclipse.
