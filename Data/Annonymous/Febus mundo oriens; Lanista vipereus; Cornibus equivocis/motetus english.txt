The viperous troublemaker.
an Ibis spreading poison.
is driven off when there is
budding strength in the community.

Thus it was when the flower-bedecked
count revealed himself a Frenchman;
the vile rumour saying he was
an Englishman came to nothing.

The shining knight ardently wishes
a good future for his realm.
which the hammer of his enemy
has attacked without moderation.

He stands firm as a rocky mountain
since no deceptive argument
can move him.
for the sharp-pointed water flower

is on him, and the sea-going
dolphin, which proclaims him
unique, while a milky whiteness
draws together the remainder.

Yea truly, bodily strength
makes you terrifying.
and adornment of royal purple
makes you angelic.
