Are these the princes who lead the way in this world?
(Here I include the dapped horses of Euripedes.)

They are brigands of Diomedes's kind
(Eve lives on words equal to their words);

they are potters who create in the hand
and who give themselves to all sorts of vice;

for these snapping whelps of the lion
are giving aid to the beasts of Celta

And our native-born of the French
weep at the harsh treads of the lion;

all of them individually give more than the norm.
but the deceivers take away twice as much;

thus they are as little pits when the fratricidal brothers
have been left fatherless, justly the slaves to a great king;

Are these thieves, petty princes
worthy to take over the palaces?

Until Febus, true to the sense of his nickname
(for I understand all of these intellectual games).

should secretly arise (whom I declared to all.
I who proclaim these things about the youth).

it can be read in the sayings of the people
that malice will never end.

Let them perish in the twinkling of an eye!
But let him seek the celestial values.
