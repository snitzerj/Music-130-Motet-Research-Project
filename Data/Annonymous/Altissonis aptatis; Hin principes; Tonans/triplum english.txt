With my sublime strength marshalled.
singing in relaxed tones.

I desire more than usual to sing praise.
that the spirit of God not cease to be generous.

with all the fibres of my body broken in praise.
and the dirty linens of my chest cast away

so that I might be able freely to extoll
above all others

Gaston, (who is) now given to the singers;
for he is the equal of Hercules in all things.

and not an Absolon who steals wealth.
nor yet a scholar who shamefully gives it up.

he came to know Cartos directly by its men.
and Catos in all its song.

and to join himself to the ways of the Stoics.
who say: "this is how one is to be happy."

If by Solonic counsel you climb to great heights
through the waves of the sea.

you will then be a perfectly rounded man; truly I am able
to say that you love reason (the rational).

Therefore, rise up against the thieves
that oppress us with so many sufferings.

and with the armed men put to flight in defeat.
be equal to the Maccabees in deeds.

so that when you have taken on the strength of Samson.
a flower may rise up out of your hands;

thus you influence the (flower?) to unfold.
you urge it to grieve for your soothsayers.

Count (Gaston), thus we are saved by you
through the leaves on the fruit tree of Cenis.
